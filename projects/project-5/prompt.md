This template uses a Markdown format for human readability.

# Instructions
- Identify the phrases in single quotes in the Class definition in English.
- Verb phrases in the English definition refer to OWL properties.
- Noun phrases in the English definition refer to OWL classes.
- The combination of a verb phrase and a noun phrase is a possible OWL restriction.
- Use the Mapping of phrases to URIREF below to lookup the URIREF for the phrases.
- Using the URIRefs, see if a similar restriction is present in the Current OWL definition.
- If the restriction is not present, propose a new OWL restriction.
- To create this restriction, use the New OWL restriction template.
