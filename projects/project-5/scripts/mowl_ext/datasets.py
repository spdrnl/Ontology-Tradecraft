class OtcPathDataset(PathDataset):
    """
    Project-specific PathDataset that overrides `evaluation_classes`.

    In mOWL, Dataset.evaluation_classes must return a pair (tuple) of OWLClasses
    collections to define the candidate space used during evaluation (e.g., for
    link prediction over subclass axioms). The base class leaves this abstract.

    Default behavior here:
    - Use the full set of classes gathered from training/validation/testing
      ontologies for both elements of the pair. This mirrors the typical setup
      in taxonomy link prediction where any class can be a potential head/tail.

    You can later specialize this to restrict to a subset (e.g., only classes
    appearing in simple named rdfs:subClassOf axioms) without changing callers.
