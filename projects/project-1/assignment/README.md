# Week 1 Project

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:

- Confirm that your Python environment is ready with required packages.
- Practice working with RDF data using `rdflib`.
- Experience the GitHub workflow (clone → commit → push → automated tests).
- Understand how **autograding** will work for future, more complex projects.

## Project
1. **Clone the starter repository** https://github.com/Applied-Ontology-Education/Ontology-Tradecraft.git.  
2. In your local repository, create a new Jupyter Notebook in `notebooks/` called `env-report.ipynb`, where you
   - Print your Python version.
   - Import `rdflib`, `SPARQLWrapper`, and `pyshacl`.
   - Parse the provided file `sample.ttl` and print the number of triples it contains.  
3. Commit and push your notebook and any code changes to GitHub.  
4. Verify that your submission passes the automated tests; if not, return to step 2. 

## Automated Grading
Your work will be graded automatically using **pytest** and GitHub Actions. Each push or pull request runs the tests, and results are shown in the **Checks** tab of your repo.

**Rubric:**
- **Python environment** (Python ≥ 3.0)  
- **Required libraries import successfully** 
- **RDF parsing works** (`sample.ttl` parsed with correct triple count = 2)   
- **Notebook executes without error**   

A passing grade requires all tests to succeed.

## Files in the Repository
- `notebooks/sample.ttl` – An RDF file with 2 triples.  
- `src/check_env.py` – A script that parses the sample RDF and prints results in JSON.  
- `tests/test_env.py` – Automated tests to verify your setup.  
- `.github/workflows/autograde.yml` – GitHub Actions workflow for autograding.  
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies.
